  description: One day, after drinking too much, a bunch of fishermen unconsciously
    created a high-end bomb with a limited radius that will remain almost totally
    steady in the sea, no matter how strong the waves are. They simply added sand
    inside an explosive barrel.
  bombRadius: 7
  bombWavesResistance: 200
